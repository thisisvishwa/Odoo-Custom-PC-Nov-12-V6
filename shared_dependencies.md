1. **Models**: The models in `product_configuration.py`, `inventory_management.py`, `pricing_engine.py`, and `advanced_features.py` will share common ORM definitions and relationships. They will also share computed fields and on-change decorators for dynamic data updates.

2. **Views**: The XML views in `product_configuration_view.xml`, `inventory_management_view.xml`, `pricing_engine_view.xml`, and `advanced_features_view.xml` will share common design patterns following Odoo's guidelines. They will also share common DOM element IDs for user interface elements.

3. **Security**: The `ir.model.access.csv` file will define access controls that are shared across all models and views.

4. **Data Files**: The `product_categories.xml` file will define data schemas that are shared across all models.

5. **Controllers**: The `main_controller.py` file will handle HTTP requests and AJAX responses that are shared across all views.

6. **Static Resources**: The `styles.css` and `scripts.js` files will define shared styles and JavaScript functions. The `img` directory will contain shared images.

7. **Tests**: The test files `test_product_configuration.py`, `test_inventory_management.py`, `test_pricing_engine.py`, and `test_advanced_features.py` will share common testing methodologies and use Odooâ€™s testing framework.

8. **Documentation**: The `README.md` file will contain shared documentation for the entire module.

9. **License**: The `LICENSE` file will contain the shared LGPL-3 license for the entire module.

10. **Initialization and Manifest**: The `__init__.py` and `__manifest__.py` files will contain shared initialization code and module metadata.
